                        Ideally, the human beings would never hurt one another.
                        This is generally because, having experienced what pain feels
                        like, we tend to not want to inflict it on others. So why do 
                        humans hurt each others? Well, it turns out pain is felt differently
                        for different people and also responded to differently. Our lack 
                        of uniformity in experience also doesn't help matters
                        Take for instance the woman the felt a lot of pain during 
                        childbirth.
